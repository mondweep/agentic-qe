## 🔴 Critical Issues Across All Branches

### Issue #1: security-check.ts (CRITICAL)

**Severity**: 🔴 Critical - Appears in ALL 3 branches
**Complexity**: Cyclomatic 95, Cognitive 109
**Location**: `npm/scripts/security-check.ts`

**Problem**:
- **Highest cognitive complexity** in entire codebase
- Single file with 95 decision points
- Extremely difficult to understand and maintain
- High risk of security vulnerabilities due to complexity

**Impact**:
- Security checks may miss edge cases
- Difficult to audit security logic
- New team members cannot easily understand
- High risk of bugs in security-critical code

**Recommendations**:

1. **Immediate (Week 1)**:
   ```typescript
   // Current: One massive security-check.ts file

   // Recommended: Modular security validators
   security-validators/
     ├── dependency-checker.ts     // Complexity: ~15
     ├── vulnerability-scanner.ts  // Complexity: ~15
     ├── license-validator.ts      // Complexity: ~10
     ├── code-scanner.ts           // Complexity: ~15
     └── report-generator.ts       // Complexity: ~10
   ```

2. **Strategy Pattern**:
   ```typescript
   interface SecurityValidator {
     validate(): Promise<ValidationResult>;
   }

   class DependencyValidator implements SecurityValidator { ... }
   class VulnerabilityValidator implements SecurityValidator { ... }
   class LicenseValidator implements SecurityValidator { ... }
   ```

3. **Testing**: Break down into testable units
   - Each validator should have < 20 complexity
   - Unit tests for each validator
   - Integration tests for orchestration

**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Address in next sprint

---

### Issue #2: temporal_neural.rs (CRITICAL)

**Severity**: 🔴 Critical - Appears in ALL 3 branches
**Complexity**: Cyclomatic 47, Cognitive 71
**Location**: `src/lean_agentic/temporal_neural.rs`

**Problem**:
- Neural network implementation with excessive complexity
- Deep nesting in training loops
- Mixed concerns (model definition + training + inference)

**Recommendations**:
1. Extract layer implementations
2. Separate training from inference
3. Use Builder Pattern for model construction

---

### Issue #3: openai-realtime.ts (CRITICAL)

**Severity**: 🔴 Critical - Appears in ALL 3 branches
**Complexity**: Cyclomatic 48, Cognitive 60
**Location**: `npm/src/openai-realtime.ts`

**Problem**:
- WebSocket handling mixed with business logic
- Multiple async patterns in single file
- Complex error handling paths

**Recommendations**:
1. Extract WebSocket connection manager
2. Separate protocol handling from app logic
3. Use state machine for connection states

---

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Branch Strategy

**Current Situation**:
- `main` and `v2-advanced-intelligence` are identical
- `claude/lean-agentic` has experimental simplifications

**Recommendations**:

1. **Merge Strategy**:
   ```
   claude/lean-agentic → main (selective merge)
     - Bring lower complexity implementations
     - Keep mature crates from main
     - Result: Best of both worlds
   ```

2. **Branch Cleanup**:
   - **v2-advanced-intelligence**: Either implement v2 features or delete
   - **claude/lean-agentic**: Complete crate implementations before merge
   - **AIMDS**: Branch failed checkout - investigate or remove

3. **Going Forward**:
   - Use feature branches for experimental work
   - Maintain complexity budgets on all branches
   - CI/CD complexity checks before merge
