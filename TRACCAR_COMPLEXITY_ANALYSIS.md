   - Extract to named methods describing the operation
   - Improve readability and testability

5. **Consider Using Guard Clauses to Simplify Control Flow**
   - Replace nested conditionals with early exits
   - Validate preconditions at method entry
   - Reduce indentation levels

### Strategic Refactoring

6. **Split Large Files Following Single Responsibility Principle**
   - ConnectionManager.java → ConnectionLifecycle, SessionManager, EventDispatcher
   - DatabaseStorage.java → DeviceRepository, PositionRepository, EventRepository
   - MainModule.java → CoreModule, HandlerModule, StorageModule, NetworkModule

7. **Group Related Functions into Separate Classes or Modules**
   - Apply cohesion principles

## 🛠️ Methodology

### Analysis Approach

This analysis was conducted using the **CodeComplexityAnalyzerAgent**, which implements:

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Counts decision points (if, for, while, case, catch, &&, ||)
- **Cognitive Complexity**: Measures mental load with nesting penalties
- **Lines of Code**: Raw line count excluding comments
- **Function Detection**: Pattern matching for method declarations

### Thresholds Used

| Metric | Threshold | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Cyclomatic Complexity | 15 | Java convention (higher than typical 10 due to language verbosity) |
| Cognitive Complexity | 20 | Maintains readability and testability |
| Lines of Code | 300 | Single Responsibility Principle guideline |

### Limitations

- Analysis is based on **10 representative files**, not the full 1,413 Java files
- Complexity metrics are **simplified** (full AST analysis would provide more precision)
- **Function count detection** may be incomplete due to Java method syntax variations
- No analysis of **test coverage**, **performance**, or **security** (handled by other agents)
